The research focus for the course Tools & Methods pertains to the examination of internationally deceased journalists resulting from violence. In this context, an integral aspect involves the creation of a visualization depicting a global representation of such violence, presented cartographically. Two hypotheses are formulated: H0 posits that journalists frequently meet their demise in conflicts within their own national borders, while H1 suggests that journalists are more prone to fatalities in conflicts situated in foreign nations. Sufficient data is currently at my disposal for conducting this research. However, a critical consideration lies in assessing the reliability of the available data, necessitating further investigation. Methodologically, I will employ a notebook, utilizing the Python programming language for data analysis, and visualization tools such as Flourish, Seaborn, and Datawrapper.
